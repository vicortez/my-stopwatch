# my-stopwatch

a simple server-side stopwatch made with express and react for no reason whatsoever

Why am i sending the time continuously instead of sending only events for start/stop/reset to save on bandwidth? For no particular reason, really. This is just a toy project to test SSE and managed cloud services
